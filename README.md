Lipcoin Standards Documents
============================

This repository contains three types of files:

* BIPs: Bitcoin Improvement Proposals
* DIPs: Lipcoin-specific variations to existing BIPs
* Standards documents: Draft standards for submission as RFCs (Request For Comments)

BIP documents are copied to this repository in order to provide a static reference point from
which DIPs are derived. DIPs are only to be used where minor modifications are required to a
BIP to make it suitable for Lipcoin.

For any innovative work or significant divergence from a Bitcoin standard, documents should
be prepared for submission as standards track RFCs.
